      <description>This page is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes&amp;hellip;)
Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.
Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.</description>

      <description>You can define additional menu entries or shortcuts in the navigation menu without any link to content.
Basic configuration Edit the website configuration config.toml and add a [[menu.shortcuts]] entry for each link your want to add.
Example from the current website:
[[menu.shortcuts]] name = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;i class=&#39;fab fa-github&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Github repo&amp;quot;identifier = &amp;quot;ds&amp;quot;url = &amp;quot;https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn&amp;quot;weight = 10[[menu.shortcuts]]name = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;i class=&#39;fas fa-camera&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Showcases&amp;quot;url = &amp;quot;/showcase&amp;quot;weight = 11[[menu.</description>

      <description>The Learn theme for Hugo loads the Font Awesome library, allowing you to easily display any icon or logo available in the Font Awesome free collection.
Finding an icon Browse through the available icons in the Font Awesome Gallery. Notice that the free filter is enabled, as only the free icons are available by default.
Once on the Font Awesome page for a specific icon, for example the page for the heart, copy the HTML reference and paste into the markdown content.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudfamily.info/en/cont/sitemap/</guid>
      <description>We should be careful about the references we include in the sitemap xml file, to avoid a high volume of pages included in the sitemap and consequently being indexed to Search Engines such as Google, Bing and more. Especially because we should mind about keeping the most relevant content in the top of the search engine index.
Configuration Hugo by default indexes all pages to the sitemap.
The proposal is just to include a parameter to the pages we want to exclude from sitemap.</description>
