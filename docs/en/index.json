	"content": "In Hugo, pages are the core of your site. Once it is configured, pages are definitely the added value to your documentation site.\nFolders Organize your site like any other Hugo project. Typically, you will have a content folder with all your pages.\ncontent\r├── level-one\r│ ├── level-two\r│ │ ├── level-three\r│ │ │ ├── level-four\r│ │ │ │ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four\r│ │ │ │ ├── page-4-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four/page-4-a\r│ │ │ │ ├── page-4-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four/page-4-b\r│ │ │ │ └── page-4-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four/page-4-c\r│ │ │ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three\r│ │ │ ├── page-3-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/page-3-a\r│ │ │ ├── page-3-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/page-3-b\r│ │ │ └── page-3-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/page-3-c\r│ │ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two\r│ │ ├── page-2-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/page-2-a\r│ │ ├── page-2-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/page-2-b\r│ │ └── page-2-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/page-2-c\r│ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one\r│ ├── page-1-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/page-1-a\r│ ├── page-1-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/page-1-b\r│ └── page-1-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/page-1-c\r├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /\r└── page-top.md \u0026lt;-- /page-top\r_index.md is required in each folder, it\u0026rsquo;s your \u0026ldquo;folder home page\u0026rdquo;\nTypes Hugo-theme-learn defines two types of pages. Default and Chapter. Both can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being layout display.\nA Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found under it. You can define any HTML as prefix for the menu. In the example below, it\u0026rsquo;s just a number but that could be an icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Basics\u0026#34; chapter = true weight = 5 pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;1. \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026#34; +++ ### Chapter 1 # Basics Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it. To tell Hugo-theme-learn to consider a page as a chapter, set chapter=true in the Front Matter of the page.\nA Default page is any other content page.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Installation\u0026#34; weight = 15 +++ The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following this great documentation for beginners.\nCreate your project Hugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u0026lt;new_project\u0026gt; Hugo-theme-learn provides archetypes to help you create this kind of pages.\nFront Matter configuration Each Hugo page has to define a Front Matter in yaml, toml or json.\nHugo-theme-learn uses the following parameters on top of Hugo ones :\n+++ # Table of content (toc) is enabled by default. Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # If set, this will be used for the page\u0026#39;s menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Set the page as a chapter, changing the way it\u0026#39;s displayed chapter = false # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a pre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the Github icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Github repo\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026#34; +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;My page\u0026#34; weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, Hugo-theme-learn will use a page\u0026rsquo;s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page\u0026rsquo;s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Install on Linux\u0026#34; menuTitle = \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; +++ Homepage To configure your home page, you basically have three choices:\nCreate an _index.md document in content folder and fill the file with Markdown content Create an index.html file in the static folder and fill the file with HTML content Configure your server to automatically redirect home page to one your documentation page "

I really enjoy being part of this amazing community.\nSo, a little about me\u0026hellip; My name is Karl Cooke and I live in Antrim, Northern Ireland. I\u0026rsquo;m married and have 4 children (3 girls and 1 boy). I work for ActionPoint Technology Group, who are an MSP and Microsoft partner based in Ireland, as an Implementation Specialist. My primary focus is Azure with some Microsoft 365 thrown in for good measure. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working for ActionPoint now for just over a year. Great company to work for! My role involves designing and deploying Azure and M365 solutions for customers of all sizes.\nI have been in the IT industry for about 10 years now, previous to that I worked as a Partnership Manager for a finance company. In 2011 I started my own business (part-time) repairing computers for people in the local area. I\u0026rsquo;ve been full time for the last 7 years having worked my way up through the helpdesk to the project-based work I do now.\nI really love Azure and enjoy learning as much as I can about it every day. I\u0026rsquo;m currently chasing the Azure Solutions Architect Expert cert.\nCommunity: If you follow my Blog or follow me on Twitter you will know that I love community! I believe that each one of us has something we can give back to the communities we exist in. It\u0026rsquo;s so exciting to be able to help other people on their journey.\nThe CloudFamily community is such a welcoming place. I\u0026rsquo;ve made connections, and hopefully friends :), in this community that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have made if CloudFamily didn\u0026rsquo;t exist. You are all awesome humans!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a long-time observer in the tech community but over the last 6 months I\u0026rsquo;ve made a conscious effort to give as much back to the community as possible. I\u0026rsquo;m very active on Twitter and I blog at https://irishtechie.com/.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also a co-organiser for the Limerick DotNet Azure User Group https://www.meetup.com/Limerick-DotNet/. Check out our meetup page for upcoming events.\nFor the rest of 2021, I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking to ramp up the community engagement by releasing more blog posts and working towards delivering my first user group talk before the end of the year. You can all hold me accountable for that goal!! :).\nLater this month, I\u0026rsquo;ll be appearing on the CloudWithChris show. My friend Thomas Thornton and I also just recorded an episode of the JonnyChipz \u0026ldquo;In Conversation with\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; show with John Lunn.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to continuing to contribute to this amazing community.\nCheck out the links below for ways to connect with me. I\u0026rsquo;m always happy to make new friends!

	"content": " Jonah Andersson - @cjkodare About Hi to my CloudFamily! This month of May 2021, I am humbled and honored to be a Cloud Champion in our cloud family :)\nMy name is Jonah Andersson, I am Filipina-Swedish full stack Software Developer/ Software Engineer and Cloud Developer in Sweden.\nI studied Computer Science in the Philippines and when I moved to Sweden 10 yrs ago, I studied more programming - Agile System Development in .NET and Java.\nAs you noticed, I am pretty passionate about tech and learning!\nI like solving challenging complex problems, programming back-end and have great interest in developing applications in .NET with new cloud technologies like Microsoft Azure. I like continuous learning, connecting with other developers, learning from others, sharing my technical knowledge at my workplace and by public speaking at virtual tech events.\nA few years ago, I used to teach programming to kids in schools on the side of my job as a Software Developer.\nI saw the challenges we need to do something about. I myself have experienced the negative effects of gender inequality at the workplace. Therefore, I personally, want to make a difference by advocating gender equality, diversity and inclusion in tech through modern technologies like cloud. I usually volunteer to mentor young women and help them choose a career in tech. We need more female role models to inspire.\nJonah Andersson with her Belgian Malinois dog Playing Chess In my free time, I like training my Belgian Malinois dog, blogging about Azure, gardening, photography, code mini-programming projects and play chess. If any of you reading this like to play chess as well, feel free to message me. I like to develop my chess-playing skills by playing more!\nIf you want to learn more about me feel free to visit my website and read my inspiring story to tech and software engineering on DEV Community - Inspiring Story of Software Developer Jonah Andersson in Sweden - SheCoded in 2021!\nCommunity: Jonah Andersson @ the Virtual Azure Community Day Community Presentations Just this past year, I have been actively sharing my technical knowledge about Microsoft Azure by speaking at User Groups and Virtual Events. I really like the sense and collaboration of the tech communities I\u0026rsquo;ve become with so far. So you will find me speaking about Azure, tech, gender diversity or anything about software development. I am a deep thinker programmer - I just don\u0026rsquo;t like writing code and understanding more logic, but I also like sharing knowledge through writing on my blogs or speaking about what I am passionate about.\nTech and cloud communities like we have these days are great ways to unite, collaborate and join powers through knowledge sharing and I really like that. I am glad to discover such communities that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know existed.\nAzure Hero Badges I am one of the Azure Heroes in Sweden. As of the date of this blog, I have about 24 #AzureHeroes digital badgers like Content Hero, Inclusive Leader and some Kudos and Learner badgers.\nIn February 2021, I took the initiative to create a local Meetup group called Azure User Group Sundsvall - Sweden because I saw that was missing in my area. Currently, I am organizing events for this group alone but looking forward to expanding it remotely and finding more co-organizers who are also passionate about sharing knowledge about Azure like I do.\nAzure User Group Sweden If you are interested in sharing Azure knowledge and speaking, please connect with me and we can organize it. Please feel free to join the Meetup group as well, even if you are not located in Sweden :)\nContact Info Twitter: https://twitter.com/cjkodare Website: https://jonahandersson.tech/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonahandersson Facebook: http://facebook.com/jonahanderssontech Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonahandersson_ladyprogrammer/ GitHub: https://github.com/jonahandersson "

	"content": "\rThis page is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes\u0026hellip;)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown\u0026rsquo;s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it\u0026rsquo;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown\u0026rsquo;s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown\u0026rsquo;s syntax is the format of plain text email. \u0026ndash; John Gruber\nGrav ships with built-in support for Markdown and Markdown Extra. You must enable Markdown Extra in your system.yaml configuration file\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nBookmark this page for easy future reference!\nHeadings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;h1 Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; with any of the following:\n___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks renders to:\nBody Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.

To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code \u0026ldquo;fence\u0026rdquo;, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:\nRenders to:\ngrunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: \u0026#39;docs/assets\u0026#39;, data: \u0026#39;src/data/*.{json,yml}\u0026#39;, helpers: \u0026#39;src/custom-helpers.js\u0026#39;, partials: [\u0026#39;src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\u0026#39;] }, pages: { options: { layout: \u0026#39;default.hbs\u0026#39; }, files: { \u0026#39;./\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;src/templates/pages/index.hbs\u0026#39;] } } } }; Tables Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

Links Basic link [Assemble](http://assemble.io) Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):\nAssemble\nHTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://assemble.io\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Assemble\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Add a title [Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \u0026#34;Visit Upstage!\u0026#34;) Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):\nUpstage\nHTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/upstage/\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Visit Upstage!\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Upstage\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Named Anchors Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026quot;The Dojocat\u0026quot;\rResizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.

By default lightbox is enabled using the featherlight.js plugin. You can disable this by defining featherlight to false.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?featherlight=false) "

He believes that a tech blog is a great way for a techie to hold a repository of their experience, and the feeling of being able to reach and share that knowledge with people from around the World is amazing.\nHe continues to share his experiences today at his blog cloudbuild.co.uk\nWhilst remaining anonymous, Imran continued sharing his knowledge via his blog and eventually used social media such as twitter to automatically share what he published. Imran became more active within the Tech community towards the end of the year 2019, when he was surprised to discover a great tech community on Twitter.\nPeople who had a massive passion for sharing knowledge and willing to help. He has since been active on Twitter and has met (virtually) hundreds of amazing people from around the world.\nAzureCrazy.com After discovering a great tech community on Twitter, Imran had a light bulb moment to setup a website with the aim of connecting new and existing users of Microsoft Azure to this great community. The Azure Crazy website would give an insight to readers on how the experts started their Microsoft Azure journey and in turn help promote and grow the Azure community. Initially just an idea which Imran was not sure about pursuing, he reached out to a member of the Tech community, Gregor Suttie, who supported Imran and encouraged Imran to implement the idea.\nImran has also compiled a list of approximately 100 great Azure related blogs at Azure Blogs | AzureCrazy.com\nToday, thanks to the tech community, the website has a number of written interviews from Microsoft Azure fans who have shared their experiences including Microsoft employees. The @AzureCrazy twitter account has over 1500 followers.\nHow to Build an Azure Community Imran had a great discussion with Microsoft MVP Mert Yeter on how to build an Azure Community, the importance of sharing knowledge, and how to get started with blogging.\nBradford Cloud User Group\nImran is a co-founder of the Bradford Cloud User Group which was launched during the Covid-19 Pandemic with co-founders Shabaz Daar and Mohammed Sajid. The aim of the group is to promote Tech in a town located in the UK named Bradford and assist those beginning their tech journey\u0026rsquo;s.\nInitially camera shy, the group has also given Imran the opportunity to start speaking in public with his web cam switched on!! 😊\nSince the groups launch, the user group has held several live sessions with the support of the tech community including sessions on Azure Stack, VMWare in Azure, Microsoft 365, AWS and more! The group also holds monthly podcast sessions and aims to locate and recognise those individuals who have made a difference including giving new speakers a platform to share their knowledge and boost their confidence.\nThe first Bradford Cloud User Group podcast announcement\nThe BradCug team were invited to the Azureish Live show. Our first interview as a team.\nCertifications Imran enjoys studying to gain new certification and he also uses the opportunity to blog about what he learns. He has recently started to study and document automating workloads into Azure using Terraform, and has also purchased an Azure IOT development kit.\nOther amazing stuff\nImran enjoys spending time with his family and travelling to new places. He enjoys playing Snooker from time to time (I\u0026rsquo;m not a professional before anyone asks!)\nContact Info Twitter: @ITSupportBlog Website: AzureCrazy.com Azure Crazy Twitter: @AzureCrazy Happy to help, so please feel free to reach out.\n"

	"content": " May Alhajri - @MayAlhajri2 About My Name is May Alhajri and you can call me Agent 008 :)\nLiving in Saudi Arabia and I\u0026rsquo;m half Saudi half Syrian, I have been graduated with bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in computer engineering. I started my career in oil and gas industry as IT Onsite support. I have 5 years experiences in different areas. My current position is Digital Analyst within Schlumberger company.\nIn 2017:\nAs we know working as IT onsite support is a daily routine and for me it was a fun at the beginning, then I started to search within my company on any platform that\u0026rsquo;s will help me to communicate with others across different countries within Schlumberger. Then I found my favorite tool \u0026ldquo;Yammer\u0026rdquo;, with Yammer I started to share with others my knowledge (IT Onsite Knowledge, videos, posters and more) internally.\nIn 2018:\nI have been assigned to be part of the Office365 migration project within my company, I started to learn more about OneDrive, SharePoint and all Office365 Tools in deep. Then I heard about \u0026ldquo;Power Bi\u0026rdquo;, from here my Power Platform journey started.\nI learned more about it, and shared whatever I learned internally on Yammer. Sharing my knowledge with others on Yammer helped me to develop myself more and more.\nIn 2019-2020:\nI built my first Dashboard on Power Bi for the KSA Schlumberge Finance department. The idea behind it was to show the status of our invoicing tickets from our clients. It was a challenging task for me because I was not expert with Power Bi, but the Powerful things with all power platform tools is you can learn while you are working on it.\nAfter this project, most of the people they started to call me within my company \u0026ldquo;Power Bi Lady\u0026rdquo;! actually this name gave me a confidante on myself to learn more and develop my skills to the next level.\nThen I started to learn more about \u0026ldquo;Power Apps, Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents\u0026rdquo;. The Secret Sauce to learn any new tool is:\nLearn and share with others Ask others if they have any question Do a session on what you learned\n2020-2021:\nI have been promoted to be Digital Analyst within Schlumberger. I worked on several projects and automate several manual processes.\nI found myself with Power Platform\nCommunity I started learning about Power Platform earlier 2019, starting with Power Bi and ending up by Powering up my daily work with Power Platform Tools.\nThen I Joined #PowerAddicts community on Dec-2019 and starting learning from the community and sharing my knowledge at the same time.\n2020 was really a good opportunity for me to learn more and build my community within my region - Saudi Arabia. I created #SharingIsCaring Meetup group with 0 members and now I have around 490 from different countries within few months.\nSharing my knowledge is my favorite part of my day through all my social media accounts. Therefore, sharing my knowledge is the best way to learn and retain knowledge for myself.\nMy Community Contributions:\nI shared my story within #PowerAddicts Hangout session:- https://youtu.be/fVC8ITH8WxY\nI shared my story with TechStyler community:- https://youtu.be/5r_HK0gkZYI\nI shared my story with Jonnychipz show:- https://jonnychipz.com/2021/07/23/jonnychipz-in-conversation-with-may-alharji/\nI shared my story with Lisa show:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUdQlGGvlpo\nBuilding my community within KSA on Meetup by having around 490 members within few months.

	"content": " James Cook - @OfficialCookJ About James Cook is an Infrastructure Analyst who is currently changing careers and moving into a DevOps Engineer role in September.\nOver the past 10+ years, James has worked in many roles within the tech industry. His first opportunity in tech was during his A Level studying where he was able to work alongside the schools IT team. Once his A Level studies were completed, James was accepted into an Advance IT Academy for five months where he would focus on practical skills as well as CompTIA and Microsoft certifications. During his last week at the IT Academy James applied, interviewed, and was offered the position of Technical Consultant at a Not-for-Profit education company. Here James moved up the ranks and took technical lead on the company\u0026rsquo;s growing services such as Apple MDM/OSX and Google Workspace, moving into the position of Technical Architect.\nJames has spent the past 18 months reskilling with Microsoft Cloud technology. He has attained expert certifications, implemented new technologies and learnt new practices such as DevOps. He is now contributing back to the community he learnt from.\nCommunity James used community content to grow his knowledge of Cloud and DevOps. At a point in his studies, he decided to start giving back what he can to help others who are on the same journey. James\u0026rsquo;s ability to document deployments and procedures is a skillset highlighted in every position he held. As such, his first content contribution was a post on his newly created blog Cloud and DevOps with James Cook (jamescook.dev). James set out a plan to release one post every week, using notes and projects he\u0026rsquo;s been working to write articles and how to instructions.\nHis blog has been visited by over thirteen thousand readers in the past six months and his post highlighted in Microsoft\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;s Azure DevOps weekly post.\nSome months passed and James wanted to be more involved in the community than just writing technical posts. James went on Twitter, shared an idea which got a very good reaction from other individuals from the community. A few days later the AZ Community Roundtable twitter.com/azroundtable podcast was created, ran on Twitter Spaces live and recorded for distribution on other podcast platforms. As host of the show, James invites two guest speakers from the Microsoft Azure community to discuss their individual talking point they prepared before the show. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what your skillset are, James invites anyone who has worked with Azure and has a topic to discuss.\nJames continues to grow his community contributions, participating in community events and shows. He has recently launched a Discord server for content creators of Microsoft products (60+ members) so others can collaborate and help one another grow.\nOther amazing stuff James is working on creating content for his YouTube channel. He is releasing weekly YouTube Shorts on projects he is working on as part of a DevOps role.\nFinally, James recently took up golf and sets aside time away from the computer to switch off and recharge.\nContact Info Twitter - https://twitter.com/OfficialCookJ Website - https://jamescook.dev LinkedIn - https://linkedin.com/in/cookjames/ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSBWstI-cJlZFYxudyMlgrw PolyWork - https://www.polywork.com/jamescook GitHub - https://github.com/Official-James "
