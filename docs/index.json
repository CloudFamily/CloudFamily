	"content": "In Hugo, pages are the core of your site. Once it is configured, pages are definitely the added value to your documentation site.\nFolders Organize your site like any other Hugo project. Typically, you will have a content folder with all your pages.\ncontent\r├── level-one\r│ ├── level-two\r│ │ ├── level-three\r│ │ │ ├── level-four\r│ │ │ │ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four\r│ │ │ │ ├── page-4-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four/page-4-a\r│ │ │ │ ├── page-4-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four/page-4-b\r│ │ │ │ └── page-4-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/level-four/page-4-c\r│ │ │ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three\r│ │ │ ├── page-3-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/page-3-a\r│ │ │ ├── page-3-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/page-3-b\r│ │ │ └── page-3-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/level-three/page-3-c\r│ │ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two\r│ │ ├── page-2-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/page-2-a\r│ │ ├── page-2-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/page-2-b\r│ │ └── page-2-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/level-two/page-2-c\r│ ├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one\r│ ├── page-1-a.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/page-1-a\r│ ├── page-1-b.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/page-1-b\r│ └── page-1-c.md \u0026lt;-- /level-one/page-1-c\r├── _index.md \u0026lt;-- /\r└── page-top.md \u0026lt;-- /page-top\r _index.md is required in each folder, it\u0026rsquo;s your \u0026ldquo;folder home page\u0026rdquo;\n\rTypes Hugo-theme-learn defines two types of pages. Default and Chapter. Both can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being layout display.\nA Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found under it. You can define any HTML as prefix for the menu. In the example below, it\u0026rsquo;s just a number but that could be an icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Basics\u0026#34; chapter = true weight = 5 pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;1. \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026#34; +++ ### Chapter 1  # Basics Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it. To tell Hugo-theme-learn to consider a page as a chapter, set chapter=true in the Front Matter of the page.\nA Default page is any other content page.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Installation\u0026#34; weight = 15 +++ The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following this great documentation for beginners.\nCreate your project Hugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u0026lt;new_project\u0026gt;\rHugo-theme-learn provides archetypes to help you create this kind of pages.\nFront Matter configuration Each Hugo page has to define a Front Matter in yaml, toml or json.\nHugo-theme-learn uses the following parameters on top of Hugo ones :\n+++ # Table of content (toc) is enabled by default. Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # If set, this will be used for the page\u0026#39;s menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Set the page as a chapter, changing the way it\u0026#39;s displayed chapter = false # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a pre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the Github icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Github repo\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026#34; +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;My page\u0026#34; weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, Hugo-theme-learn will use a page\u0026rsquo;s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page\u0026rsquo;s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Install on Linux\u0026#34; menuTitle = \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; +++ Homepage To configure your home page, you basically have three choices:\n Create an _index.md document in content folder and fill the file with Markdown content Create an index.html file in the static folder and fill the file with HTML content Configure your server to automatically redirect home page to one your documentation page  "

	"content": "\rThis page is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes\u0026hellip;)\n\rLet\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\n Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use!  John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\n The overriding design goal for Markdown\u0026rsquo;s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it\u0026rsquo;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown\u0026rsquo;s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown\u0026rsquo;s syntax is the format of plain text email. \u0026ndash; John Gruber Grav ships with built-in support for Markdown and Markdown Extra. You must enable Markdown Extra in your system.yaml configuration file\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nBookmark this page for easy future reference!\n\rHeadings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;h1 Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; with any of the following:\n ___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks  renders to:\n   Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.

To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code \u0026ldquo;fence\u0026rdquo;, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:\nRenders to:\ngrunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: \u0026#39;docs/assets\u0026#39;, data: \u0026#39;src/data/*.{json,yml}\u0026#39;, helpers: \u0026#39;src/custom-helpers.js\u0026#39;, partials: [\u0026#39;src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\u0026#39;] }, pages: { options: { layout: \u0026#39;default.hbs\u0026#39; }, files: { \u0026#39;./\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;src/templates/pages/index.hbs\u0026#39;] } } } }; Tables Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header.

Links Basic link [Assemble](http://assemble.io) Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):\nAssemble\nHTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://assemble.io\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Assemble\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Add a title [Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \u0026#34;Visit Upstage!\u0026#34;) Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):\nUpstage\nHTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/upstage/\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Visit Upstage!\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Upstage\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Named Anchors Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one.
