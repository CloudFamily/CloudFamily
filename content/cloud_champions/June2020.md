### About
Lisa Clark lives in Dundee, Scotland with her Maine Coon Kizzi and works for Dell Technologies. 

 

Recently, with the extra time lockdown has provided she started a podcast called 'Lisa at the Edge'.  This podcast provides a platform to discuss and share the knowledge on Tech Careers and Hybrid Cloud.  Lisa started this podcast as a way to engage with the tech community during lockdown and also as an excuse to talk to and learn from amazing community members.  There are currently 10 episodes available and Lisa is in the process of scheduling in the next 10. 

 

Lisa is a Business Development Strategist for EMEA focussed on the Azure Stack portfolio.  Lisa works with Microsoft, Speciality sales teams within Dell and SME's to bring the right people together to in order to support customers in realising their Microsoft Hybrid Cloud goals.  Lisa is very passionate about enabling customers to harness the power of hybrid cloud and the intelligent edge and is a big fan of the Azure Stack portfolio for this reason. She is always keen to cut through the FUD which surrounds cloud to find the right solution and deliver value.

### Community

A big supporter of the tech community Lisa is fascinated by the different backgrounds from which people in technology come from.   Having come from a non-technical background herself (Lisa has a Law Degree) she is keen to share these stories through her podcast to show that anyone can enjoy a rewarding and fulfilling career in tech.

Lisa played a big part in the Global Azure Virtual 2020 event this year for the UK & Ireland Communities and did a great job moderating and asking questions of the speakers!
