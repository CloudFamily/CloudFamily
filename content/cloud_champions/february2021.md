### About
I live in South Wales UK and am employed by BT Enterprise as A Technical Architect where I have worked for the last 8 years. 
I help design and Architect BT customers Cloud Adoption and transformation projects covering predominantly Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.

I am also a Cloud Academy Cloud Advocate for BT internally as well, which allows me to help generate interest and evangelise Cloud concepts to help colleagues upskills and adopt Cloud concepts.

I have over 20 years working experience within IT ranging from support analyst to developer, from consulting to architecture.
I am a Co-organiser of the Welsh Azure User Group 

I am married and have 3 kids (1 boy and 2 girls) who are now all in high school, my hobbies include music and movies, I have played in bands since the age of 13 and am an avid drummer and play guitar on occasion!

### Community:

I absolutely love the Cloud Family and all the fantastic people I have met (virtually) since being more community focussed. It is something that I have wanted to do for years as I love trying to help explain complex topics in hopefully a simplified manner to help people that maybe just starting off on their IT journey or Careers. I have had a varied, fun and exciting work career to date, and I feel its time that I helped the next generation!
I regularly visited schools as a volunteer Barefoot Trainer (pre-covid) as part of the Barefoot computing programme to help teachers include computational thinking techniques in Key Stage 1 and 2 pupil lessons. I hope to get back to this just as soon as we are able to. 
I help organise the Welsh Azure User Group which was established in July 2020 so it has been virtual events only, we are very excited to start arranging face to face meetups as soon as we can!
I have a blog site which I use to publish various bits of information in and around the cloud computing industry and I have recently started 2 series on my YouTube channel:
In Conversation with which will go out every Friday at 6.30pm where I catch up with community and business leaders and experts to find out the view of Cloud from their experience and viewpoints.
