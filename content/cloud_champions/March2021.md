### About

Hey everyone, thank you so much for featuring me as **'Community Champion'** of the month! It is really great to be involved with such an inclusive and supportive community.

I got started in the DevOps space just about half a year ago, after working for several years in the blockchain space as Community Manager and within Developer Education. Now I am part of the Developer Evangelist team at Codefresh.

As you can imagine, getting started in a new industry, I have quite a lot to learn. Since many others are probably on a similar journey, I have decided to make all of my learning public on my notion page (https://devops.anaisurl.com/), as well as on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/AnaisUrlichs).

My goal is to show that you can learn anything that you put your mind to. For the most part, I am trying to figure everything out on the go. You do not have to be an expert that others get value out of your learning journey and understanding of a topic.

If you have any questions or feedback, I am happy to connect. (https://devops.anaisurl.com/contact)
