### About
I live in South Wales UK and am employed by BT Enterprise as A Technical Architect where I have worked for the last 8 years. 
I help design and Architect BT customers Cloud Adoption and transformation projects covering predominantly Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.

### Community:

I absolutely love the Cloud Family and all the fantastic people I have met (virtually) since being more community focussed. It is something that I have wanted to do for years as I love trying to help explain complex topics in hopefully a simplified manner to help people that maybe just starting off on their IT journey or Careers. I have had a varied, fun and exciting work career to date, and I feel its time that I helped the next generation!
I regularly visited schools as a volunteer Barefoot Trainer (pre-covid) as part of the Barefoot computing programme to help teachers include computational thinking techniques in Key Stage 1 and 2 pupil lessons. I hope to get back to this just as soon as we are able to. 
I help organise the Welsh Azure User Group which was established in July 2020 so it has been virtual events only, we are very excited to start arranging face to face meetups as soon as we can!
I have a blog site which I use to publish various bits of information in and around the cloud computing industry and I have recently started 2 series on my YouTube channel:
In Conversation with which will go out every Friday at 6.30pm where I catch up with community and business leaders and experts to find out the view of Cloud from their experience and viewpoints.
