### About
Marc Duiker **LOVES** serverless, developer communities and creative coding! He works for **Xpirit as a Lead Azure Consultant** and loves working with event-driven architectures, and serverless technology such as Azure Functions, Durable Functions, Cosmos DB, and various messaging products.

He is an **Azure MVP** since 2019 and regularly blogs and vlogs about Azure Functions & Durable Functions.

### Community


Marc is co-organizer of **{{< open-in-blank "ServerlessDays Amsterdam" "https://www.meetup.com/ServerlessDays-Amsterdam/" >}}** (both the Meetup and the conference). About once a month they organize a meetup (all online these days on YouTube and Twitch) where various speakers present their view on serverless.

Next to ServerlessDays he regularly helps as a host or crew-member for various Microsoft technology related conferences such as **{{< open-in-blank "Virtual Azure Community" "https://vacd2.azureday.community/" >}}** Days and **{{< open-in-blank "DUUGFest" "https://live.df20.nl/" >}}**.

To provide up-to-date information about Azure Functions, Marc created the **{{< open-in-blank "Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot." "https://twitter.com/az_func_updates" >}}** This bot monitors dozens of Azure Functions related GitHub repositories and tweets when new releases are available.
