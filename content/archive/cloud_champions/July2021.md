### About
**Simon Lee**, Originally born in the midlands, Now living in Bradford, I started my career in the Education sector and progressed to working for Managed Service Providers.

I've worked with various technologies from VMware, Veeam, Altaro and the Microsoft Stack.

I'm also known for having a Home Lab, Dubbed **'MiniDatacenter'** This has been invaluable to me during the years when I first started, It allowed for personal development and learning on enterprise networking
and deployments, Again this started back in the days of Citrix XenSerer the moved to VMware vSphere ESXi 5.0 and then finally to Hyper-V, When Microsoft released their 2012R2 Hyper-V Server OS. 

In its current iteration, I'm using a repurposed Sophos UTM 220, Running the OPNSense Firewall Distribution, Two Dell R620 1U Servers, Running Hyper-V 2019, Configured in a Two Node Cluster. For Storage I've got a Dell R720XD with about 3Tb of useable space at the moment, Split between SATA and SAS.


This also currently hosts the HypervLAB Blog, Which is built on a Ubuntu 21.04.01 LTS Virtual Machine.

### Community
I first started  in the Tech Community Area, When I met **Richard Hooper** at the Microsoft Tech Summit back in 2018, From there we moved to Twitter and the rest is pretty much history.

Without the use of Twitter, I doubt I would have learnt so much and branched out into helping run events and start presenting at user groups. - Personally, I found the Twitter Community an invaluable resource, not just from a technical standpoint, But some of the people I've met **"Virtually""** and in-person are just brilliant, down to earth humans, who just love technology and seeing people grow and for that, I cannot thank them enough.

In June, I've just recently completed a mini-series on Azure Virtual Desktop with **Shabazz Darr**, Which has been a great insight into how AVD is configured and deployed.
